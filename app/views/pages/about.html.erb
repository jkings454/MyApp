		<h1> About Me</h1>
		<p>My name is Josh Nichols. I was born on December 4th, 1996. I love video games, coding, and occasionally horror films. I've got a strange taste in music and a stranger personality, 
		but that doesn't stop me from pursuing my dream of being a software developer. I hope to one day develop software that will change the world (and make me rich).</p>
		<p>This is the first ever app that I've made on my own. Using rails 4.1.8, ruby 2.1.5p273, notepad++, github, bootstrap, and html and css. There's no real point to this app, 
		other than to show off my amazing coding skills. Feel free to use any code you find in this app.</p>
